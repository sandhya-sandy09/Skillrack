In a zoo there are some birds and animals.
All birds have two legs and all animals have four legs.
GIven the head count and leg count of both birds and animals taken together, the program must print the head count of birds and animals separated by a space as output.
Input Format: First line will contain the integer value H representing the head count of both birds and animals taken together. 
Second line will contain the integer value L representing the leg count of both birds and animals taken together. 
Output Format: First line will contain the integer values of the head count of birds and animals separated by a space.
Sample Input/Output:
Example 1: 
Input:
27 84 
Output:
12 15
Explanation: There are 12 birds and 15 animals.

Solution : use mathematical formula. Solve the equation

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ZooAnimals {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int H = sc.nextInt();
        int L = sc.nextInt();
        int b = (4 * H - L) / 2;
        int a = H - b;
        System.out.println(b + " " + a);
    }
}
